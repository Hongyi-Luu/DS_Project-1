## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There are no specific libraries required to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code is compatible with Python version 3 and should run without issues.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in analysing the Seattle Airbnb dataset from 2016 to uncover any patterns that could offer insights into its pricing strategies and other details. After browsing the dataset available on Kaggle, I identified three business questions that sparked my interest the most. Therefore, offering some comments or insights on these questions serves as the purposes for my exploration:

1. What Day Should You Book Your Visit to Seattle? 
2. When Does Seattle Truly Come Alive?
3. Choosing Your Seattle Stay: Property and Room Types? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

A single notebook, titled 'main.ipynb', is available here to showcase the work related to the above-mentioned questions. The three CSV files are the main datasets used in this study. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hongyiluu/when-to-book-and-where-to-stay-analysing-seattles-airbnb-trends-04d34b76017b).
